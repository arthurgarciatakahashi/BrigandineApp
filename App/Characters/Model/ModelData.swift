    var background = "Lance was the prince of the kingdom of Almekia and was poised to inherent the throne until Zemeckis staged his coup. As his kingdom was reorganized into the Esgares Empire, he fled west and took refuge in the kingdom of Padstow to avoid suffering the same fate as his father. King Coel, the elderly ruler of Padstow, saw Lance as an inspiring young man who could lead the people through difficult times, so he abdicated and allowed Lance to take the throne. Padstow became New Almekia, and Lance resolved to avenge his father's death and reclaim his birthright. After capturing Logres and defeating the Esgares Empire, Lance can change his class to King."
